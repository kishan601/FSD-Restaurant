# Modern Web Starter Project

This is a starter template for building modern, framework-less web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be a starting point for projects in Firebase Studio, providing a clean and organized structure for your code.

## Project Structure

The project follows a basic structure:

```
.
├── index.html      # The main HTML file and entry point of the application.
├── style.css       # The main stylesheet for the application.
├── main.js         # The main JavaScript file for application logic.
├── gallery/        # A directory for images.
├── .gitignore      # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
└── README.md       # This file.
```

## Getting Started

1.  **Open in Firebase Studio:** This project is ready to go in Firebase Studio.
2.  **Live Preview:** The IDE provides a live preview of your application as you make changes.
3.  **Start Coding:** Open `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js` to start building your application.

## Core Technologies

*   **HTML5:** Using modern, semantic HTML for structure.
*   **CSS3:** Leveraging modern CSS features like variables, flexbox, and grid for styling.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Writing clean and modern JavaScript.
*   **Web Components:** A suggestion for creating reusable UI components without a framework.

## Firebase Integration

This project is set up to easily integrate with Firebase services.

*   **Firebase Hosting:** You can deploy this static site directly to Firebase Hosting.
*   **Other Firebase Services:** Easily add Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, and more by including the Firebase SDKs.

### Deployment

To deploy your site to Firebase Hosting:

1.  **Login to Firebase:** If you haven't already, you'll be prompted to log in to your Google account.
2.  **Initialize Hosting:** Set up Firebase Hosting for your project.
3.  **Deploy:** Run the deploy command. The Firebase CLI will upload your files and provide you with a live URL.

## Development Guidelines

This project encourages the use of modern web standards (Baseline) for creating high-quality, maintainable, and performant web applications. Refer to the `GEMINI.md` file for more detailed AI development guidelines within this project.
